# Infinity League

You, yes you, Pokemon trainer!

After defeating Red in the final battle on top of Mt. Silver

The weather turns colder than it has ever been

Your pokemon faint one by one as you tremble

Unable to do a single thing to prevent this

No escape rope, no useful item to give you warmth

You start to loose consciousness and fall into a dream

You recall the day when you chose your first starter

All the battles you have done to gain experience and level up

But its of no use now

As darkness consumes you, you find yourself in a strange realm

A place where the rules of Pokemon battles are twisted

Where you have to fight not for badges, but for survival

Where every victory brings you closer to escape

And a single defeat brings you death

This is the Infinity League

A tournament with no end, no mercy, and minimal chances of escape

Can you conquer the Infinity League and find your way back home?

Or will you become just another lost soul in this eternal tournament?

The choice is yours, trainer.

The battles await.
