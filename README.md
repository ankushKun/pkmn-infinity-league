# Infinity League

After defeating Red in the final battle on top of Mt. Silver

The weather turns colder than it has ever been

Your Pokemon faint one by one as you tremble

Unable to do a single thing to prevent their fall

No escape rope, no useful item to give you warmth

You start to loose consciousness and fall into a slumber

You recall the day when you chose your first Pokemon

All the battles you have done to gain experience and level up

But what use is it now...

As darkness consumes you, you find yourself in a strange realm

A place with twisted rules

Where you have to fight not for badges, but for survival

Where every victory brings you closer to escape

And defeat brings you death

This is the Infinity League

A tournament with no end, no mercy, and minimal chances of escape

Can you conquer the Infinity League and find your way back home?

Or will you become just another lost soul in this eternal tournament?

The choice is yours, trainer.
